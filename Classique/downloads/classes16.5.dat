UNIQUE-ID - Generalized-Reactions

UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been assigned.
/To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Databases
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Notes

UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - KB-DESCRIPTOR
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Paralogous-Gene-Groups
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Each instance of this class describes a single group
/of paralogous genes.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathways
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - This class is the root of a classification hierarchy for metabolic
/pathways.  Its subclasses divide pathways into groups
/based on their biological functions, and based on the classes
/of metabolites that they produce and/or consume.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical transformation of some type.  It
/may involve small molecules or macromolecules.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - GO:0005575
TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - cellular_component
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

UNIQUE-ID - GO:0003674
TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - molecular_function
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Reactions
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Gene-Products
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the
/corresponding protein.  Relevant regulatory mechanisms include those that directly interfere with or facilitate the translation process,
/as well as those involving processing of the mRNA transcript to promote or inhibit its degradation before translation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Holder-Class
TYPES - Chemicals
COMMON-NAME - a nonspecific substrate

//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - TAX-1
TYPES - Organisms
COMMON-NAME - root
SYNONYMS - all
//
UNIQUE-ID - Multi-Organism-Groupings
TYPES - Organisms
COMMENT - Instances of this class represent amalgamations of multiple organisms.  This class is used to indicate PGDBs

//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Media
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - A growth medium is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/The set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biomass-Compositions
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.
/The biomass set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from experiment
COMMENT - Inferred from experiment.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/wet-lab experiment of some type.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-IC
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by curator
COMMENT - Inferred by curator.  An assertion was inferred by a curator from relevant
/information such as other assertions in a database.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Binding-Features
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biosynthesis
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Biosynthesis
COMMENT - This class contains pathways that constitute a cell's complete spectrum of biosynthetic capacities, including the routes of synthesis of small molecules, macromolecules and organelles.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and TCA cycle), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Signaling-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Signal transduction pathways
COMMENT - Signalling pathways.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transport-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Transport
//
UNIQUE-ID - Detoxification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms protect themselves 
/against the harmful effects of toxic compounds.
/The sole purpose of these pathways is to avoid toxicity, with no other 
/benefit (such as energy or useful metabolites) to the organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Super-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Superpathways
COMMENT - Pathways within this class are constructed by combining individual pathways
/(elsewhere shown separately) to show relationships between them.
/In some cases those individual pathways start from a common precursor, or
/produce a common product, but they can have other relationships as well.
/Superpathways can have individual reactions as their components in addition to
/other pathways.  Superpathways can be defined recursively, that is, the
/component pathway of a Superpathway can be a base pathway or a child of
/Superpathways.  Most Superpathways will have an additional parent class
/within the pathway ontology to define their biological role.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Degradation
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms degrade substrates to serve as sources of nutrients and energy, utilize exogenous sources of essential metabolites, or assimilate certain sources of essential bioelements.   
/
SYNONYMS - Assimilation
SYNONYMS - Utilization
//
UNIQUE-ID - Metabolic-Clusters
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Metabolic Clusters
COMMENT - A metabolic cluster is a set of biochemical reactions that are biologically related, but are largely unconnected, 
/and therefore do not constitute a pathway in the traditional sense of the word.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Unclassified-Reactions
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Unclassified reactions
COMMENT - Reactions that have not yet been classified either by substrate or by conversion type.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
TYPES - Reactions
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified by the type of 
/transition that occurs, whether by a change in covalent bonding, by a  weak binding interaction,
/or via a complex multistep process, etc.  This reaction ontology is orthogonal to the classification 
/of reactions by substrate classes, that is, many reactions will have parents in both ontologies.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Substrate
TYPES - Reactions
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified according to
/the class of their substrates.  This classification scheme is orthogonal to the
/classification by conversion type, that is, reactions will have parents in both
/ontologies.

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,

/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by

//
UNIQUE-ID - Interconversion
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Interconversions
COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the
/bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule to a different form. The forward and
/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.
//

UNIQUE-ID - Complex-Processes
TYPES - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
COMMENT - Each instance of this class represents a complex, multistep, black-box process.  Details of the process may or may not
/actually be known, but are not described in this frame.  Therefore, the entire process is considered to be a black box that
/we cannot see within.  Examples of processes that might be represented in this manner are protein degradation,
/transcription and translation.  When it is not clear whether a given transition is caused by a single reaction or
/by a complex process, use Unknown-Conversions.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Simple-Reactions
TYPES - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
COMMENT - An instance of this class should be a single reaction involving only a small number of defined participants, 
/in contrast to large complicated processes that can be better classified under the Complex-Processes
/class (e.g., transcription or translation).  Simple-Reactions should be considered indivisible at the current level of abstraction,
/but it is possible to define a decomposition of a simple reaction into a lower level set of sub-reactions, that
/exist at a different level of abstraction.  Simple-Reactions are therefore simple in comparison to
/Complex-Processes, not because they cannot be decomposed.

/occurs as a complex process or as a single reaction step.  An example is the conversion
/of an inactive form of a protein to an active form, when the exact chemical forms of the protein, and the nature 
/of the transition from one form to the other are not known.  For transformations that are known

COMMON-NAME - signaling receptor activity
COMMENT - Note that this term and its child terms are intended for receptors that are directly coupled to a signal transduction pathway. This term should therefore not be used to annotate decoy receptors and other proteins that bind a signal but do not pass the signal on. This term can be used to annotate dependence receptors that transduce a signal when a ligand is withdrawn (in this case, signal withdrawal is considered to be the initiating signal), or receptors that signal at a basal level in the absence of a bound agonist. For receptors that mediate transport of a substance into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, consider instead the term 'cargo receptor activity ; GO:0038024' and its children.

UNIQUE-ID - Allosteric-Regulation-of-RNAP
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation by an alarmone, which is produced by the cell under conditions of stress.  The alarmone
/binds to RNA-Polymerase, changing its promoter preference, and thus regulating transcription initiation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

Some of them, |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| and related compounds, are ubiquitous as membrane constituent of eukaryotes (for instance, up to 10% of the dry mass of yeast is |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL|) and as the precursors of all steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids.
/
/Interestingly, with exception of methane-oxidizing bacteria that contain relatively large amounts of sterols, sterols are absent from most prokaryotes. However, many bacterial membranes contain |FRAME: Hopanoids hopanoids|, which are similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules |CITS: [18039763]|.

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - cyanophycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cyanophycin Cyanophycin| is an amino acid polymer that is found in most cyanobacteria. It is a high-molecular weight copolymer, composed of an |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| backbone and |FRAME: ARG| side groups, with typical size of  25-100 kDa. The arginine moieties are linked to the &beta;-carboxyl group of each aspartate by its &alpha;-amino group.
/
/Cyanophycin is largely insoluble under physiological conditions and is accumulated in the form of granules in the cytoplasm during phosphate or sulfur starvation, generally in the early and mid-stationary phase |CITS: [16591901]|.
/
/The polymer serves as a temporary nitrogen reserve, which accumulates during the transition from the exponential- to the stationary-growth phase and disappears when balanced growth resumes.
/
/Even though cyanophycin is considered largely exclusive for cyanobacteria, it is also found in a few heterotrophic bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-62977| |CITS: [11976746][15289556]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Poly-Gamma-Glutamates
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - poly-&gamma;-glutamate
COMMENT - Poly-&gamma;-glutamate (PGA) is a natural polymer that is synthesized by several bacteria (all Gram-positive), archaea and (so far) one eukaryote (|FRAME: TAX-6073|). PGA has diverse biochemical properties, enabling it to play different roles, depending on the organism and its environment. Pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-1392| use it to produce a capsule that protects them from host defense systems |CITS: [2984311]|. Soil bacteria use released PGA for the sequestration of toxic metal ions |CITS: [16348371]|. The bacteria |FRAME: TAX-1371| and |FRAME: TAX-1570|, as well as the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-64602| (the only archaea known to produce PGA) use it to decrease high local salt concentrations |CITS: [Kandler83][11411682]|. |FRAME: TAX-6073| use PGA to trigger the explosion of nematocysts, stringing cells used to capture prey, for locomotion and for defence |CITS: [1693614]|.
/
/PGA was first described in |FRAME: TAX-1392| at the start of the 20th Century. This organism produces a capsule that is composed solely of PGA. The capsule enables the bacteria to escape phagocytosis, and therefore acts as a virulence factor. The |FRAME: TAX-1392| capsule is composed exclusively of the D enantiomer, making it non-immunogenic. However, other bacteria may produce PGA that contains either only D, only L, or a mixture of the two |CITS: [16689787]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are:
/
/1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these peroxiredoxins contain two conserved cysteines and are
/homodimeric enzymes where the two subunits interact in the catalytic cycle and are linked via a
/disulfide bond in the oxidized form. Eukaryotic 2-Cys proxiredoxins, which are exclusively localized
/in the chloroplast, are also shown to regulate H2O2-mediated signal transduction |CITS: [9263459]|.
/
/2. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine and are
/preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.
/
/3. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| (also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these can use
/thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as the reductant and can exist in multiple isoforms localized in plants in
/many subcellular compartments, including one form in plastids |CITS: [12913160]|.
/
/4. |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins| ((also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these are
/homologues of the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migrating protein and function as monomers
/|CITS: [10998352]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic
/acid-free at the protein level.
/The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by
/protein templates, and each biosynthetic step generally requires a protein module.
/A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain
/for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into
/multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide
/synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes
/|CITS: [15487945]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Pathogenicity-Islands
TYPES - Genomic-Islands
COMMENT - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are a class of genomic islands that are present in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms, but are usually absent from non-pathogenic
/organisms of the same or closely related species.  They contain genes that code for one or more virulence factors, such as adhesins, toxins, invasins, etc.  PAIs are discrete genetic units flanked by direct repeats, insertion sequences or tRNA genes, which are sites for recombination into the DNA.   They can be transferred as a single unit to new cells, thus conferring virulence to formerly benign strains.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phantom-Genes

/been observed.  They are maintained in the database to maintain a
/record of their past versus current status.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - This class describes functional genes (it excludes, for example, pseudogenes) 
/that code for protein and RNA products.  Genes of known function are
/classified into one or more applicable classes under MultiFun, a gene
/ontology developed by M. Riley.  Genes whose function is unknown or known
/only approximately are assigned to the subclasses ORFs and Unclassified-Genes,
/respectively.  GO (Gene Ontology) assignments are implemented using the 
/GO-TERMS slot within gene products.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Pseudo genes are regions of DNA that show sequence similarity to other functional genes, but that
/are not in fact functional genes.   A pseudogene might be nonfunctional because of sequence
/changes that prevent its transcription or translation, such as by disrupting its promoter
/or by introducing a premature stop codon.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - REP-Elements
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - A Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) element is a short base pair sequence capable of producing a stem-loop structure.  REP elements
/are located in different orientations and arrays between genes within an operon or at the end of an operon.  They are always found
/outside of structural genes.  Groups of REP elements are also known as BIMEs (bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements).  The actual function of these
/elements is unclear.  They may act as mRNA stabilizers, targets for DNA gyrase binding, or hot spots for transposition and recombination events.
//

/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.

COMMON-NAME - hydroxymethylbutenyl pyrophosphate reductase activity
COMMENT - Note that the enzyme performing this function has only recently been characterized, and not completely (see PMID:11818558). The common and systematic names have been suggested by TIGR, who have recently compiled an HMM model for this gene (TIGR00216). The enzyme appears to catalyze the final step in the non-mevalonate terpene biosynthesis pathway. Its two products, isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, are apparently generated from a common intermediate formed by the enzyme. The mechanism and identity of the reductant have not yet been determined.

The lipid moiety is mainly two (sometimes one or three) &beta;-hydroxy fatty acid chains (represented here in part by R1 and R2) linked to each other through an ester bond between the &beta;-hydroxyl group of the chain distal to the glycosidic bond with the carboxyl group of the chain proximal to the glycosidic bond.  The carboxyl group of the distal chain is usually free, but in a few cases it is esterified with a short alkyl group.  The fatty acid chains may be saturated, mono-unsaturated, or poly-unsaturated and the chain length may vary from C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub>.  In rare cases the rhamnose 2-hydroxyl group distal to the glycosidic bond may be acylated with a long chain alkenoate. |CITS: [16160828] [20336292]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Elemental-Sulfur
TYPES - Inorganic-Compounds
COMMON-NAME - S<sup>0</sup>
COMMENT - Elemental sulfur appears in a number of different allotropic modifications: rhombic, monoclinic, polymeric,
/and others. The rhombic structure is the most common.
/Both the rhombic and monoclinic forms of sulfur are made up of eight sulfur atoms arranged in a
/puckered-ring structure. At one atmosphere pressure and temperatures less than 95.4C, rhombic is the
/stable crystalline form. Above 95.4 C to the melt temperature of 118.9 C, the monoclinic crystalline
/structure is dominant |CITS: [Steudel00]|.
/
/In addition, elemental sulfur always contains some polymeric sulfur consisting of chain-like
/macromolecules. The S-S bond energy is lower in polymeric sulfur than in ring sulfur |CITS: [17379736]|.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: Lactones "lactone"| is a cyclic ester, the product of condensation of an alcohol group and a carboxylate group
/within the same molecule. It is characterized by a closed ring consisting of two or more carbon atoms and a single oxygen atom, with a ketone group in one of the carbons adjacent to the ring oxygen.
/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.
/
/The name lactone is derived from the lactone of |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, which is called
/|FRAME: CPD-9549|, although it is really a di-lactone.

/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-glycerol phosphate,
/while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-ribitol phosphate.
/In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages.  It should be noted
/that strain 168 also possesses a minor form of wall teichoic acid, which is comprised of
/poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/Membrane teichoic acids, also known as lipoteichoic acids, are similar polymers of glycerol phosphate, but are
/linked to glycolipid molecules located in the cell membrane |CITS: [406922]|.
/Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as
/"contaminants" in bacterial extracts from <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> |CITS: [2662967]|.
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized
/when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|.  Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular
/Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through

COMMENT - Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced by some bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
/Polyketides are usually biosynthesized by polyketide synthase enzymes (PKS) through the decarboxylative condensation of extender units that are derived from malonyl-CoA, in a process similar to fatty acid synthesis.
/
/PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - a polyprenol
COMMENT - The nomenclature of polyprenols and polyprenyl phosphates is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Polyprenols are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/According to one method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/The other method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. According to this method the same molecule is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. 
/For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

/|FRAME: Factor-IX "factor IX"| and its its cofactor, |FRAME: Factor-VIII "factor VIII"|, or a complex known as "extrinsic Xase", which includes
/|FRAME: Factor-VII "factor VII"| with its cofactor, tissue factor (TF).
/
/|FRAME: Factor-X "Factor X"| acts by cleaving prothrombin in two places (an arg-thr and then an arg-ile bond), generating the active thrombin. This process is optimized when factor Xa is complexed with activated co-factor V in the prothrombinase complex.

COMMON-NAME - a DsrC sulfur carrier protein
COMMENT - DsrC is a small protein essential for both sulfur oxidation and sulfur reduction systems.
/Depending on conditions, DsrC can be bound to the DsrA and DsrB subunits of the sulfite reductase complex.
/
/The protein contains two conserved |FRAME: CYS| residues. During catalysis a sulfur atom is added as a perthiol to one of these cysteines. DsrC transfers the sulfur to its receptor in a reaction that involves the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.

/
/Most of the characterized electron-transferring flavoproteins belong to a single group. These proteins, including those from mammals |CITS: [8962055]|, plants |CITS: [16923016]|, and some bacteria, such as the methylotrophic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-2327| |CITS: [7798207]|, and the soil bacterium |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [10026281]|, are heterodimeric, contain one non-covalently bound FAD and one AMP per molecule, and function as electron carriers between other flavoproteins (such as |FRAME: ACYLCOADEHYDROG-MONOMER "acyl-CoA dehydrogenases"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6421|, and |FRAME: CPLX-7462|) and ubiquinone, depending on the source species.
/
/A different type of ETF has been characterized from the anaerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-907|. This ETF is also a heterodimer but contains two FAD molecules. The presence of AMP has not been reported. The function of |FRAME: TAX-907| ETF is to transfer electrons between flavoproteins, |FRAME: CPLX-5242| (DLDH) and |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) |CITS: [14688238]|, and additionally to oxidize NADH |CITS: [4364030][4365840]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [citrate-lyase] (citryl form)
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

UNIQUE-ID - Sulfurylated-ThiI
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a ThiI persulfide
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

COMMON-NAME - a rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013]|. 
/
/When a photon is absorbed by the retinal chromophore, it isomerizes from |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| (while bound to the protein) and induces a conformational change in the opsin. In mammalian cells this process is known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations: 
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade.

/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized ferredoxin
COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes. 
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/The first group consists of monomeric proteins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster, which includes ferredoxins
/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. 
/
/The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from
/anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxins are small redox proteins known to be present in nearly all organisms and function in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxins have a characteristic tertiary structure known as the thioredoxin fold, and contain two vicinal cysteines in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines form the cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site, and allow thioredoxin to reduce other proteins.
/
/The thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|, which utilizes NADPH as the electron source. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates. In addition, thioredoxins can also act as electron donors to certain proteins, such as the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|.
/
/|FRAME: Glutaredoxins Glutaredoxins| share many of the functions of thioredoxins, but are reduced by glutathione rather than a specific reductase. 
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The first group (|FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins|) consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaces by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

COMMENT - The human &beta;-amyloid precursor protein is an 87 kDa protein is cleaved into multiple peptides. Cleavage by either &alpha;-secretase, &beta;-secretase or &theta;-secretase via the major secretory pathway leads to generation and extracellular release of soluble APP peptides (S-APP-alpha and S-APP-beta) and the retention of the corresponding membrane-anchored C-terminal fragments C80, C83 and C99. Subsequent processing of C80 and C83 by gamma-secretase yields P3 peptides (P3(40) and P3(42)).
/
/Alternatively, presenilin/nicastrin-mediated gamma-secretase processing of C99 releases the amyloid beta proteins, amyloid-beta 40 (A&beta;40) and amyloid-beta 42 (A&beta;42), major components of amyloid plaques, and the cytotoxic C-terminal fragments, gamma-CTF(50), gamma-CTF(57) and gamma-CTF(59).
/
/Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. They bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, they can reduce Cu2+ and Fe3+ to Cu+ and Fe2+, respectively.
/
/Functions as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis.

COMMON-NAME - DsbD
COMMENT - DsbD is an inner membrane protein that transfers electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the
/periplasmic substrate proteins DsbC, DsbG and CcmG. DsbD consists of three domains: a periplasmic
/N-terminal domain (nDsbD), a central transmembrane (TM) domain (tmDsbD) with eight predicted TM
/helices and a periplasmic C-terminal domain (cDsbD) |CITS: [10760137]|.
/
/The electron cascade is
/initiated by the reduction of tmDsbD by thioredoxin, cDsbD then shuttles electrons from tmDsbD to
/nDsbD and reduced nDsbD passes the electrons onto the periplasmic substrate proteins. It appears that
/unlike DsbB, which has a bound quinone for electron transfer |CITS: [10854438]|, tmDsbD is capable of
/shuffling electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm without involvement of an additional cofactor
/|CITS: [18571669]|. Transfer of electrons across the membrane is thought to occur via thiol disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[12925743], [17641688], [19258316]|.

COMMON-NAME - a ThiI sulfur-carrier protein
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.

COMMENT - Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| contain a structure element that is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive, making penicillins powerful antibiotics.
/
/Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.
/
/PBPs have been classified into several classes and types. |FRAME: Class-A-PBPs "Class A proteins"| are bifunctional proteins that also contain a glycosyltransferase domain. |FRAME: Class-B-PBPs "Class B proteins"| are bifunctional proteins that also play a role in cell morphogenesis by interacting with other proteins involved in the cell cycle. |FRAME: Class-C-PBPs "Class C proteins"| are smaller, monofunctional proteins, and have been divided into several types - |FRAME: Class-C-Type-4-PBPs "Type-4"|, |FRAME: Class-C-Type-5-PBPs "Type-5"|, |FRAME: Class-C-Type-7-PBPs "Type-7"| and |FRAME: Class-C-Type-AmpH-PBPs "Type AmpH"| |CITS: [18266856]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - Retinochromes
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a retinochrome
COMMENT - Retinochrome is a photosensitive pigment located primarily in the inner portions of the visual ceils of cephalopods. Its absorption spectrum resembles that of |FRAME: Rhodopsins rhodopsin|, but its chromophore is |FRAME: RETINAL|, which light isomerizes to |FRAME: CPD-881|, the reverse of the situation in rhodopsin |CITS: [6036171][4512007][235007]|. The function of retinochrome is believed to be the regeneration of |FRAME: CPD-881| from |FRAME: RETINAL| produced by the rhodopsin photoreaction |CITS: [2626821][1541344]|.
/
/Retinochrome is synthesized in the |FRAME: Apo-Retinochromes "<i>apo</i> form"|. The active retinochrome is produced by the reversibly covalent binding of |FRAME: RETINAL|. Isomerization of |FRAME: RETINAL| into |FRAME: CPD-881| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change, resulting in the less stable |FRAME: Metaretinochromes metaretinochrome| form.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

', because thyroid hormones can only be formed by the proteolysis of a larger molecule (see term definition). The word 'generation' is therefore used in place of biosynthesis.

COMMON-NAME - protein secretion by the type II secretion system
COMMENT - Note that this term represents an activity and not a cellular structure. Consider also annotating to the cellular component term 'type II protein secretion system complex ; GO:0015627'. This process refers specifically to secretion across the outer membrane. For components of the Sec and Tat pathways, consider annotating to 'protein transport by the Sec complex ; GO:0043952' and 'protein transport by the Tat complex ; GO:0043953'. Note that this term is used for annotation of proteins that compose the secretion complex but not the proteins being secreted.

COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain.  The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/
/The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

UNIQUE-ID - Strigolactones
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a strigolactone
COMMENT - Strigolactones are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.
/

UNIQUE-ID - Lignins
TYPES - Aromatic-Polymers
COMMON-NAME - a lignin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Lignins Lignin| is a complex phenolic biopolymer and an integral part of the secondary cell walls of plants and some algae. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, exceeded only by |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, and constitutes from a quarter to a third of the dry mass of wood.
/
/During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.
/
/Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
/The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strengtth.
/
/Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: DIARYLPROPANE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Microviridins
TYPES - Nonribosomal-Peptides
COMMON-NAME - a microviridin
COMMENT - The microviridins are the largest known cyanobacterial oligopeptides. This group is characterized by the
/multicyclic structure established by secondary peptide and ester bonds and a side chain of
/variable length. The main peptide ring consists of seven amino acids with an ester bond between the
/4-carboxy group of aspartate (position 10) and the hydroxy group of threonine (position 4) and a peptide
/bond between the 6-amino group of lysine (position 6) and the 4-carboxy group of glutamate (position 7).
/
/All amino acids in microviridins are in L-configuration and the only non-proteinogenic unit is the N-terminal
/acetic acid. Therefore, it can't be precluded that microviridins are synthesized ribosomally and that the
/tri-cyclic structure is completed by post-translational modifications |CITS: [16774586]|.

/
/Sphingomyelin is found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, it accounts for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|.  Sphingomyelin has a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelin is highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and was considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

UNIQUE-ID - DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE
TYPES - HOLO-CITRATE-LYASE
COMMON-NAME - a [citrate-lyase] (thiol form)
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Forms| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

/electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
/flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
/ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
/The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
/sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
/iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of

COMMENT - Cytochromes c (cytC) are electron-transfer proteins that have one or more |FRAME: HEME_C| groups, which are bound to the protein by one or two thioether bonds involving sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues.
/Cytochromes c possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in cytochromes c among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species.
/Bacterial cytochromes c function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy
/metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 
/
/The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes"|  have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):
/
/|FRAME: Class-I-Cytochromes-C "Class I"| includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the heme-attachment site towards the N-terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C-terminus. Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome c2, mitochondrial cytochrome c, split-a-band cytochromes c, cytochrome c8 and cytochrome c5, respectively .
/
/|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C "Class II"| includes the high-spin cytochromes c' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome c-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.
/
/|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C "Class III"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes c3 and c7, with only around thirty residues of
/amino acid per heme group.
/
/|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C "Class IV"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme c, such as the flavocytochromes c and the cytochromes cd.

UNIQUE-ID - Halorhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - a halorhodopsin
COMMENT - Halorhodopsins are light-driven ion pump, specific for chloride ions and found exclusively in the halobacteria, that use the energy of green/yellow light to move chloride ions into the cell, overcoming the membrane potential. They are homologous to the light-driven proton pump |FRAME: Bacteriorhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin|, and similar in tertiary structure (but not primary sequence structure) to vertebrate |FRAME: Rhodopsins rhodopsins|, the pigments that sense light in the retina.
/
/Like their |FRAME: Bacteriorhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin| homologs, halorhodopsins contain a bound molecule of |FRAME: RETINAL|, which isomerize upon absorption of a photon to |FRAME: CPD-13525| |CITS: [12163076]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Aporhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013][8639666]|.
/
/
/Isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change in opsin, known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations:  
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and opsin |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607]|.

COMMON-NAME - a proteorhodopsin
COMMENT - Proteorhodopsins are photoactive proteins found in some marine planktonic prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/Like the homologous |FRAME: Bacteriorhodopsins bacteriorhodopsins| found in some archaea, proteorhodopsins consist of a transmembrane opsin protein bound to a retinal molecule, and are believed to function as light-driven proton pumps |CITS: [11943070]|.
/As in bacteriorhodopsin, the retinal chromophore of bacteriorhodopsin is covalently bound to the apoprotein via a protonated Schiff base at a lysine residue. The retinal bound to active proteorhodopsin is in the form of |FRAME: RETINAL|, and changes conformation to |FRAME: CPD-13525| uponabsorption of light.

UNIQUE-ID - Bacteriorhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - a bacteriorhodopsin
COMMENT - Bacteriorhodopsins are archaeal proteins related to vertebrate |FRAME: Rhodopsins rhodopsins|, the pigments that sense light in the retina. Unlike the eukaryotic rhodopsins, bacteriorhodopsins capture light energy and use it to move protons across the membrane and out of the cell. 
/
/Bacteriorhodopsins are integral membrane proteins, and are usually found in two-dimensional crystalline patches known as "purple membranes", which can occupy up to 50% of the surface area of the archaeal cell. 
/
/Each becteriorhodopsin chain contains a bound molecule of retinal. Upon absorbing a photon, the retinal changes conformation from |FRAME: RETINAL| to |FRAME: CPD-13525|. This change results in a conformational change of the surrounding protein and the proton pumping action.

COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

Further characterization of Trx1 <i>in vitro</i> has shown that it can reduce the disulfides that are formed during catalysis by a range of enzymes, including |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| |CITS: [7016827]| and |FRAME: EG11433-MONOMER "methionine sulfoxide reductase"| (Msr) |CITS: [4392601]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with |FRAME: TAX-562| mutant strains have confirmed these observations |CITS: [11544348]|. In addition, thioredoxin 1 can also transfer electrons to  the membrane protein |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|, which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases/oxidoreductases encoded by |FRAME: EG11070| and |FRAME: G6333| |CITS: [12004064]|. 
/
/Trx1 is also required for the assembly of the filamentous |FRAME: TAX-562| phages f1, T7 and M13, though this function is not related to its redox properties |CITS: [3533930]|.

COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes. 
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The first group consists of monomeric proteins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster, which includes ferredoxins
/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from
/anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - GLUTAREDOXIN-A
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a classical dithiol glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Classical glutaredoxins harbor a CPYC active-site sequence. This group includes small (9-12 kDa)
/proteins, and includes the first described glutaredoxin - the E. coli GRX1 protein, as well as the E. coli
/GRX3, the S. cerevisiae GRX1 and GRX2, and mammalian and phage T4 glutaredoxins |CITS: [11898418]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - GLUTAREDOXIN-C
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a GST-related dithiol glutaredoxin
COMMENT - This group of glutaredoxins has been defined based on the E. coli GRX2 protein. The members of
/this group are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase proteins, but incorporate the CPYC
/active-site motif that is found in classical glutaredoxins.
/T\Memebrs of this group have been found in |FRAME: TAX-666|, |FRAME: TAX-487| and
/|FRAME: TAX-714| |CITS: [11898418]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

COMMON-NAME - ACP phosphopantetheine attachment site binding involved in fatty acid biosynthetic process
COMMENT - Note that this term was moved from transporter to binding because we decided that ACP is not a true transporter, but instead tethers the growing entity that is acted on to make the fatty acid, so binding is the more correct parent. July 2012.

COMMON-NAME - transcription regulatory region DNA binding
COMMENT - The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

COMMENT - Note that the synonym 'DNA underwinding' should not be confused with 'DNA unwinding ; GO:0006268', which refers to DNA strand separation, and is a type of geometric change. GO:0006265 refers to alteration of the superhelical density of double-stranded DNA. Note that DNA topological change and DNA geometric change (GO:0032392) are distinct, but are usually coupled in vivo.

UNIQUE-ID - PLASTOQUINONE
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinone
COMMENT - |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: PLASTOQUINOL-1|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX490-29|. Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Anthraquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an anthraquinone
COMMENT - Anthraquinone derivatives are found in microorganisms, fungi, plants, marine organisms, and insects. In higher plants, most anthraquinones occur as mono- or diglycosides. The yellow or red colored compounds have some commercial relevance as natural dyes. 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones serve as laxatives.
/
/In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the s uccessive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha-keto-acyl chain which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an ubiquinone
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures

/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-559292| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

COMMON-NAME - a UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide
COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and
/contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation.
/The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases
/can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599]
/[5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few
/coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-7688| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the
/&alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY|
/|CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578|
/|CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is
/involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common
/residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all
/Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia,
/lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and
/cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been
/documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|,
/|FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|,
/|FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. 
/In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of
/<i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as
/|FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER|
/|CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species
/enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE|
/|CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide
/antibiotic vancomycin.

UNIQUE-ID - Quinones
TYPES - Cyclic-Ketones
COMMON-NAME - a quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

COMMENT - This class of triacylglycerols contains three acyl chains formed by the esterification of glycerol with three fatty acids. The names of triacylglycerol compound classes provide information about the three acyl chains of each member of the class, using the nomenclature TAG(a:b/y:z) where "a" represents the number of carbons found in one acyl chain and "b" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "a" and where  "y" represents the total number of carbons found in the other two acyl chains and "z" represents the total number of desaturations present in the two chains included in "y." 
/
/Therefore, in this TAG(18:2/34:0) class of compounds, one acyl chain has 18 carbons and two double bonds. The other two acyl chains have a total of 34 carbons and no double bonds. The attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1 (sn-1), R2 (sn-2), or R3 (sn-3) position along the glyceryl backbone may vary among class members and cannot be inferred from their order in the compound class name. Additionally, the location and orientation of the double bonds in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may vary among members of the class and are not specified by this notation.

COMMON-NAME - a diacylglycerol(18:3/16:0)
COMMENT - This class of diacylglycerols contains two acyl chains formed by the esterification of glycerol with two fatty acids. One acyl chain has 18 carbons and three double bonds. The other acyl chain has 16 carbons and zero double bonds. The location and orientation of the double bonds present in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may differ between different members of this class of compound. Similarly, the attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1   (<i>sn</i>-1), R2 (<i>sn</i>-2), or R3 (<i>sn</i>-3) position may vary. In all members of the class the R group not associated with an acyl chain represents a hydrogen.

/
/Only two of the stereoisomers occur naturally:

UNIQUE-ID - Phenylurea-Cytokinins
TYPES - Cytokinins
COMMON-NAME - a phenylurea-type cytokinin
COMMENT - Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.

/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.
/
/Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the <i>N</i>-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.
/
/The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.

/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of fewer than six carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.

UNIQUE-ID - Glucosyl-ceramides
TYPES - Ceramides
COMMON-NAME - a glucosylceramide
COMMENT - Glucosyl ceramides are a type of sphingolipid. Each member of this class has a long carbon chain attached at position R1 to form a long chain base and a long carbon chain is attached at position R2 to form a fatty amide. Either or both of these chains may contain one or more double bonds and may have hydroxyl groups attached.
/
/Based on the notation GlcCer(m:n)-p used to name subclasses of glucosylceramides, the total number of carbons present in the sphingoid base and the fatty amide is "m" while the total number of double bonds is "n." The total number of hydroxyl groups (not including the hydroxyl group used as the site of the head group attachment) is "p." The length, hydroxylation position, double bond position, and double bond orientation of the groups attached at R1 and R2 will differ between individual members of this group of compounds.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Apo-Fatty-Acid-Synthase-ACPs
TYPES - apo-ACP
TYPES - Fatty-Acid-Synthase-ACPs
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>- fatty acid synthase [acyl carrier protein]
COMMENT - This class includes the inactive form of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), universal and highly conserved carriers of acyl intermediates during fatty acid synthesis.
/In yeast and mammals, ACP exists as a separate domain within a large multifunctional fatty acid synthase polyprotein (type I FAS), whereas in bacteria and plastids it is a small monomeric protein (type II FAS). Bacterial ACPs can also serve as acyl donors for synthesis of a variety of products, including endotoxin and acylated homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their "apo" inactive form, and are activated by attachment of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to a serine residue, in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: HOLO-ACP-SYNTH-RXN "4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase"| |CITS: [18059524]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Apo-Aryl-Carrier-Proteins

//
UNIQUE-ID - NRPS-PCP-Proteins
TYPES - Peptidyl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an NRPS containing a [peptidyl-carrier-protein] domain
COMMENT - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are typically polyfunctional modular megasynthases found
/mainly in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, and participate in assembly line biosynthesis of
/peptide-based natural products, such as the antibiotic vancomycin and the siderophore enterobactin.
/The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein
/(PCP) domains.
/
/The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of
/an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond
/formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor
/by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.
/
/PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that
/contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of
/D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is isofunctional with |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxin| (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. 
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+ reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

TYPES - Thioredoxin-B
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin 2
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) was first identified in E. coli. It contains two distinct domains: a C-terminal domain with the conserved WCGPC active site signature and an additional N-terminal domain of 32 residues which includes two conserved CXXC motifs |CITS: [9388228]| responsible for the tight binding of a zinc atom |CITS: [12952960]|.
/
/<i>In vitro</i> studies showed that E. coli Trx2 is a functional Trx, as it is capable of reducing insulin and ribonucleotide reductase and is an electron donor for 3?-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase |CITS: [9388228][10075658]|. <i>In vivo</i>, Trx2 can substitute for Trx1 function, but only when Trx2 is overexpressed.
/
/The crystal structure of Trx2 from Rhodobacter capsulatus was determined, confirming that the fold of the C-terminal domain is similar to that of Trx1 |CITS: [17913712]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Red-thioredoxins-1
TYPES - Red-Thioredoxin
TYPES - Thioredoxin-A
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin 1
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/
/Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) was first identified <i>in vitro</i> as a protein disulfide reductase that acts on |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX "ribonucleotide reductase"| in 1964 |CITS: [14245400]|. Further characterization of Trx1 <i>in vitro</i> has shown that it can reduce the disulfides that are formed during catalysis by a range of enzymes, including |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| |CITS: [7016827]| and |FRAME: EG11433-MONOMER "methionine sulfoxide reductase"| (Msr) |CITS: [4392601]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with |FRAME: TAX-562| mutant strains have confirmed these observations |CITS: [11544348]|. In addition, thioredoxin 1 can also transfer electrons to  the membrane protein |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|, which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases/oxidoreductases encoded by |FRAME: EG11070| and |FRAME: G6333| |CITS: [12004064]|. 
/
/Trx1 is also required for the assembly of the filamentous |FRAME: TAX-562| phages f1, T7 and M13, though this function is not related to its redox properties |CITS: [3533930]|.

COMMENT - The cobalt- and iron-containing corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP) is functional in the |FRAME:CODH-PWY| of autotrophic carbon fixation in various bacteria and archaea, where it is essential for the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA.
/
/CoFeSP acts in two methylation reactions: the transfer of a methyl group from methyltransferase-bound methyltetrahydrofolate to the cob(I)amide of CoFeSP (during which the cobalt is oxidized to the (III) state), and the transfer of the methyl group of methyl-cob(III)amide to the reduced Ni-Ni-[4Fe-4S] active site cluster of acetyl-CoA synthase, during which the cobalt is restored to its active (I) state |CITS: [16983091]|.

COMMENT - AmpH-type penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are similar to class C &beta;-lactamases (such as AmpC), but do not show &beta;-lactamase activity |CITS: [9324260][16402224]| (or show a weak one |CITS: [8491712]|). 
/The exact enzymatic function of these enzymes is generally not determined.
/
/Studies with the E. coli AmpH suggest that the protein may play a role in the normal course of peptidoglycan synthesis, remodeling or recycling |CITS: [18266856]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Class-C-Type-7-PBPs
TYPES - Class-C-PBPs
COMMON-NAME - a type 7 class C penicillin-binding protein
COMMENT - Type 7 penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are soluble. They are similar to |FRAME: Class-C-Type-5-PBPs "type 5"| proteins, but lack the C-terminal domain that anchors those proteins to the membrane.
/
/The E. coli type-7 protein PBP7 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the D-alanyl-&epsilon;-meso-2,6-diaminopimelyl cross-bridge bond in high-molecular mass sacculi. It has no carboxypeptidase activity |CITS:[7925376][8063800]|. The enzyme may be an autolysin, but its precise role ris still unclear.
/
/On the other hand, type-7 PBP4 protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae does have a carboxypeptidase activity |CITS: [14686916]|. These different activities are likely to be a function of the location of the protein active site at either the outer face (endopeptidase) or inner face (carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase) of the peptidoglycan |CITS: [18266856]|.
/
/Type-7 PBPs are absent from most Gram-positive bacteria that have been studied so far, with the exception of the VanY<sub>D</sub> D,D-carboxypeptidase, a part of the VanD vancomycin resistance cluster (see |FRAME: PWY-6454|) |CITS: [7810996][11344152]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Class-C-Type-4-PBPs
TYPES - Class-C-PBPs
COMMON-NAME - a type 4 class C penicillin-binding protein
COMMENT - Not all bacteria contain a type 4 penicillin-binding protein (PBP), and most of those that do possess only a single such protein. Streptococcus coelicolor and some cyanobacteria are the only bacteria that are known to possess two type-4 PBPs |CITS: [18266856]|.
/
/Type-4 PBPs are not anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via a transmembrane helix, and are believed to be very loosely associated with the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8117464]|. 
/
/An <i>in vivo</i> endopeptidase activity has been shown for some type 4 enzymes, including PBP4 of E. coli |CITS: [2046551][14661974]|. It has been suggested that these enzymes may belong to the pool of autolysins |CITS: [7487333]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Class-C-Type-5-PBPs
TYPES - Class-C-PBPs
COMMON-NAME - a type 5 class C penicillin-binding protein
COMMENT - Type-5 penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are similar to type 7 PBPs, but differ in having a C-terminal domain that has been shown to be essential for the correct functioning of the protein |CITS: [11325933]|. This C-terminal domain ends with an amphipathic helix that associates the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane. Type 7 PBPs, on the other hand, are soluble.
/
/With the exception of |FRAME: MONOMER-15473| of |FRAME: TAX-1280|, type-5 PBPs are strict D,D-carboxypeptidases, and are unable to catalyze a transpeptidation reaction |CITS: [368033]|. They play a major role in the control of cell diameter and correct septum formation |CITS: [15576782][16870778][15009891]|. Most bacteria produce one major type-5 PBP, which is the most abundant low molecular weight PBP they produce, and several other type-5 proteins that are less abundant |CITS: [18266856]|.

COMMON-NAME - core promoter proximal region sequence-specific DNA binding
COMMENT - The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

COMMON-NAME - post-translational protein modification
COMMENT - This term should only be used to annotate a protein modification process that occurs after the protein has been released from the ribosome, and is therefore strictly post-translational. Modification of a free protein (one not attached to a ribosome) and modification of a C-terminal residue are post-translational processes. Some protein modifications occur while the protein is still in the ribosome but before translation has been completed; these modification processes are considered co-translational and should not be annotated using this term.

UNIQUE-ID - Hemicelluloses
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - hemicellulose
COMMENT - Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.
/
/The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
/Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.
/
/Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.
/
/Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
/However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.
/D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.
/
/Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.
/
/Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

/tRNA and the largest tRNA in <i>E. coli</i> and other organisms. It is charged by seryl-tRNA synthase, but the
/immediate product seryl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> does not insert serine residues at UGA codons in the process of
/translation.  Only after it has been converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> does it recognize UGA. Then a
/selenocysteine residue is inserted. tRNA<sup>sec</sup> is essential for synthesizing active selenoproteins, of which
/ <i>E. coli</i> has three |CITS: [1702199]|.

TYPES - Apo-Aryl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an apo-AsbD protein
COMMENT - AsbD is an aryl-carrier protein that activates |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| prior to its incorporation into |FRAME: CPD-9985|. 
/The AsbD protein itself needs to be activated by the transfer of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| group from |FRAME: CO-A| to serine 40 of the apo form, resulting in the active holo form, in a manner similar to other acyl- and aryl-carrier proteins.
/
/The AsbC protein catalyzes the adenylation of |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|, followed by the transfer of the adenylated intermediate to the holo-asbD protein, resulting in |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| |CITS: [17346033]|.
/
/Once activated, the |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| moiety can be transferred by AsbE from |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| to different receipient molecules, including |FRAME: CPD-11479|, |FRAME: CPD-11480| and |FRAME: CPD-11481| |CITS: [18758617]|.

COMMON-NAME - an oxidized cytochrome <i>c552</i>
COMMENT - The cytochrome <i>c552</i> family includes periplasmic cytochromes that function in nitrite reduction in Gram-negative bacteria such as enteric bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio.
/The enzyme, which is encoded by the nrfA gene, covalently binds five |FRAME: HEME_C| groups and one |FRAME: CA+2| ion per monomer |CITS: [9593308]|.  
/It is believed that the cytochrome <i>c</i> encoded by the nrfB gene is responsible for the direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome <i>c552</i>.  The reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i> can then directly reduce nitrite to ammonia.
/Formate, pyruvate, ethanol, and D-lactate can serve as electron donors |CITS: [5338848][6381645][8409924] [7934939] [8057835][8039676]|.
/

COMMON-NAME - RNA splicing, via transesterification reactions
COMMENT - Note that nuclear mRNA, Group I, Group II, and Group III introns are all spliced by a series of two transesterification reactions that occur within the RNA itself, or between two RNAs in trans splicing. Some of these require one or more proteins to stabilize the catalytic conformation, while others are autocatalytic. Note that tRNA introns are spliced by a different catalytic mechanism.

COMMON-NAME - tRNA wobble position uridine thiolation
COMMENT - In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.

UNIQUE-ID - Kanamycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a kanamycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Kanamycins Kanamycins| are a group of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1967|. The compounds were discovered in 1957 by researchers in the National Institute of Health of Tokyo, Japan |CITS: [13513509][13595489]|. Due to their wide range of activity, especially against severe staphylococcal and mycobacterial infections, these antibiotics gained almost immediate acceptance, and the most common form, |FRAME: CPD-4821|, was produced commercially within a year of its discovery |CITS: [13566481]|.
/
/Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|. Kanamycins are currently used to treat a wide variety of infections.
/
/Kanamycins share several biosynthetic intermediates with other aminoglycosides, including the core moiety |FRAME: CPD-10151| and the pseudodisaccharides |FRAME: CPD-14126|, |FRAME: CPD-14125| and |FRAME: CPD-14137|.
/
/While the main product produced by |FRAME: TAX-1967| is |FRAME: CPD-4821| (R1 = NH2; R2 = OH), additional products are also produced, including |FRAME: CPD-4822| (R1 = R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>), |FRAME: CPD-4823| (R1 = OH; R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>) |CITS: [13563334][13587408]|, |FRAME: CPD-14138| (similar to |FRAME: CPD-4821|, but contains a glucose moiety instead of the kinosamine moiety) |CITS: [Adams96]| and |FRAME: CPD-4824| (R1 = R2 = OH) |CITS: [Chang80]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Lividomycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a lividomycin
COMMENT - The lividomycins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycosidic antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-282216|. The lividomycins were discovered In Japan in the early 70s |CITS: [5091208][5092785][5092786][ 4624613][4647833]|. Like other aminoglucoside antibiotics, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA |CITS: [4945812][4586150]|. 
/
/Despite promising initial results against urinary tract infections |CITS: [4579561][4579564][4203572]|, tuberculosis |CITS:[4721804][4142798]| and other respiratory tract infections |CITS: [807755][1041282]|, lividomycin never became widely used.

UNIQUE-ID - Butirosins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a butirosin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-14140 "Butirosins A"| and |FRAME: CPD-14193| are naturally occurring derivatives of the |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "2-aminoglycoside antibiotics"| |FRAME: CPD-14196| and |FRAME: CPD-14143|, respectively, produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1397| and discovered in the early 1970s |CITS: [4207954][4670491][4670492]|.
/
/The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
/
/Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Neomycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a neomycin
COMMENT - Neomycins are a family of broad-spectrum highly toxic antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1906|. They were discovered in 1949 by Waksman and Lechevalier (Waksman later received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine) |CITS: [17782716]|.
/
/Neomycin usually exists as a complex composed of two stereoisomers, |FRAME: CPD-14142| and |FRAME: CPD-14141|, which are the two active components. A third component, |FRAME: CPD-14137 "neomycin A"|, which is a degradation product, is present in small quantities.
/
/Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

COMMENT - Gentamicins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by Gram-positive bacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-1873| genus. They were discovered in 1963 by a group of scientists at the Schering Corporation |CITS: [14274893]|.
/
/Gentamicins are particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, and are bactericidal. They act by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis. Despite their high antibacterial activity, intravenous use is limited by their ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, they are used commonly as a topical treatment to skin infections. The most common form of gentamycin is the C complex, which consists of a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-14213|, |FRAME: CPD-14216|, |FRAME: CPD-14211| and |FRAME: CPD-14212|. 
/
/While the name can be written as both gentamicin and gentamycin, the former is more common, to emphasize the biological origin of the antibiotics.

UNIQUE-ID - Galactoglucomannans
TYPES - Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactoglucomannan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| (GM) and |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannans| (GGM) are the major hemicellulosic components of the secondary cell walls of softwoods, but occur only in minor amounts in the secondary cell walls of hardwoods. Both polymers consist of a bakbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues. GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues and are often branched.
/Both polymers show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/The mannan backbone of GGM from spruce wood consists of galactose, glucose, and mannose in the mole ratio 1 : 8 : 33, and contains segments of more than four mannopyranose residues, interrupted with a segment composed of both mannopyranose and glucopyranose, or two glucopyranose residues. Branches terminated by single galactose residues are attached at positions 2, 3, and 6 of mannose residues and at positions 3 and 6 of glucose residues of the backbone. Many of the mannose residues are acetylated at positions 2 and 3  |CITS: [11128591]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Galactomannans
TYPES - Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactomannan
COMMENT - Mannans are polymers composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked |FRAME: MANNOSE| residues. Pure mannans are rarely found, and most contain &alpha;(1,6)-linked galactopyranosyl side chains.
/
/The extent of galactosylation varies greatly, and the mannose : galactose ratio is one of the main characteristics of the polymer as it determines their physicochemical properties, such as solubility in water, density, and the viscosity of the solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. On one hand, slightly galactosylated linear mannans (about 4% galactose), have been isolated from the seed endosperm of vegetable ivory nut (|FRAME: TAX-115507|) and date (|FRAME: TAX-42345|). They are water-insoluble, resemble cellulose in conformation of the individual molecular chains, and occur in cellulose microfibrils of the plant tissues |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/On the other hand, heavily galactosylated polymers (up to 96%) are abundant in the cell walls of storage tissues (endosperm, cotyledons, perisperm) of many seeds. Those from the endosperm of some leguminous seeds, such as guar (|FRAME: TAX-3832|), locust bean or carob (|FRAME: TAX-20340|), and tara gum (|FRAME: TAX-191904|), are widely used commercially |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/Another important feature is the distribution of the galactopyranose residues along the mannan backbone, which affects the molecular interactions of the chains among themselves (self-association) and with other polysaccharides (cooperative associations) in solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledon plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50 000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Xylans
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - xylan
COMMENT - Xylan is a general name given for polysaccharides composed of xylose residues. It is the principal type of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in plant biomass representing the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after |FRAME: CELLULOSE| |CITS: [20113432]|.
/
/The most common form of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan|, which is found in the cell walls of plants and some algae. 
/Pure |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan "(1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is uncommon. In most cases it is decorated with additional sugars, in the form of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylan| or |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylan|.
/
/The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source. Arabinose and glucuronic acid are linked to the backbone by glycosidic bonds. Other substituents form ester bonds: acetate groups are bound directly to the backbone, while cinnamoyl (feruloyl and coumaroyl) residues are linked to the side chain arabinoses |CITS: [JOSELEAU]|.
/
/Due to its heterogeneous structure, the biodegradation of xylan requires the concerted action of a complex set of enzymes |CITS: [17008082]|. These enzymes are mainly extracellular and are secreted by numerous fungi and bacteria |CITS: [BIELY]|. The endoxylanases and &beta; xylosidases hydrolyze the main chain; the former generating short chain oligosaccharides and the latter acting on these products to liberate xylose. The side chains are hydrolyzed by glycanases, &alpha;-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases and feruloyl esterases |CITS: [11729262]|.
/
/|FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "(1->3)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is found only in cell walls of some red and green algae.

/
/|FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "Plant arabinogalactans"| (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.
/
/AG of type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. However, larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

COMMENT - Hyaluronan is an anionic, nonsulfated |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions. Hyaluronan is thought to be involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
/
/Hyaluronan is composed of repeating disaccharide unit of [|FRAME: CPD-12521|(&beta;1,3) |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|] linked by &beta; 1,4 linkages. 
/
/Though classified as a glycosaminoglycan, it differs from other members of this family. While all other glycosaminoglycans are synthesized by resident Golgi enzymes and covalently attached to core proteins, hyaluronan is synthesized at the inner face of the plasma membrane as a free linear polymer without any protein core. In addition, it is the only  glycosaminoglycan that is not sulfated |CITS: [17408700]|.

UNIQUE-ID - HEPARIN
TYPES - Glycosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - heparin
COMMENT - |FRAME: HEPARIN "Heparin"| is a polymer mainly composed of a repeating trisulfated disaccharide unit composed of |FRAME: CPD-12518| and |FRAME: CPD-12533| linked by a  (1->4) bond (often referred to as IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S)).
/
/Consecutive glycosidic linkages formed between C1 of |FRAME: CPD-12533| in one base unit and C4 of |FRAME: CPD-12518| of another unit result in the formation of the heparin polymer.
/
/While |FRAME: CPD-12518| can be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12521|, and |FRAME: CPD-12533| can be replaced by 
/|FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine|, |FRAME: CPD-12545| or |FRAME: CPD-12565|, the basic non-substituted disacchride accounts for at least 85% of heparin isolated from beef lung and about 75% of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa |CITS: [Casu89][Gatti79]|.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

The main role of the protein is to accept pairs of electrons from |FRAME: CPLX-1321| (HAO) and transfer them to a cytochrome acceptor, the tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17538| |CITS: [4372235]|.
/
/In addition, it has been shown that the protein also has significant nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. Ferrous cytochrome <i>c</i>554 reduced NO at a rate greater than 16 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable to rates of other known NO reductases |CITS: [16569009]|.
/
/The cycA gene that encodes the enzyme was identified by reverse translation of amino acid sequence obtained from peptides produced by proteolysis of the N-terminal region of the protein |CITS: [8195067]|. The sequencing of the complete genome revealed that three copies of the gene are present in the organism, named |FRAME: G-15261|, |FRAME: G-15266| and |FRAME: G-15267| |CITS: [12700255]|.

TYPES - Chitosan
COMMON-NAME - a partially acetylated chitosan
COMMENT - Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &beta;-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
/Chitosan is found in the cell walls of some phytopathogenic fungi. The natural occuring chitosan has a degree of acetylation between 20-30%, with the acetyl residues grouped into clusters.
/
/Chitosan is mostly produced commercially by deacetylation of |FRAME: CHITIN| , which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans.
/The most popular technique for obtaining chitosan is alkaline deacetylation of chitin: this involves boiling chitin in concentrated alkali (50% w/v) for several hours. This process also yields chitosan with a degree of acetylation between 20-30%. However, in such a chitosan, unlike the naturally occurring chitosan, the acetyl groups are uniformly distributed along the polymer chain.
/
/Completely de-acetylated forms of chitosan do not exist naturally, but can be synthesized by special chemical treatment.

UNIQUE-ID - Chitodextrins
TYPES - CHITIN
COMMON-NAME - a chitodextrin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CHITIN Chitin| is a polymer of repeating units of &beta;-(1,4)-linked |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (GlcNAc)<sub>n</sub>. It may be the second most abundant biopolymer in the world, after cellulose. It is the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods, such as crustaceans
/and the insects, the radula of mollusks and the beaks of the cephalopods.
/
/In nature, chitin polymers are likely to have a high degree of polymerization and are insoluble in water |CITS: [20559485]|. |FRAME: Chitodextrins Chitodextrins| are polymers that are still purely composed of &beta;-(1,4)-linked |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| residues, but they have smaller degrees of polymerization than native |FRAME: CHITIN chitin|. Though the specific upper limit for defining something as a chitodextrin is hard to define, a class of related compounds referred to as chitooligosaccharides, composed of both |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| and |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE| typically have a degree of polymerization of 20 or fewer residues |CITS: [20559485]|.
/
/In the structure shown for this compound, R1 will be a hydrogen if the |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue that it is attached to is the terminal residue on the non-reducing end of the compound. R2 will be a hydrogen if the |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue that it is attached to is the terminal residue on the reducing end of the compound. However, R1 and/or R2 may also be a single |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue or a chain of n |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residues. |FRAME: CPD-13227| is the chitin oligosaccharide formed when R1 and R2 are both hydrogen.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major hemicellulose in dicotyledon type I cell walls. The cross-linking between xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the three-dimensional matrix between adjacent cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked cellotetraose units, which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues at two or three of the first three glucosyl residues, but not in the position closest to the reducing end |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are subsequently further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues at the second and/or third xylose residue and by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose at the galactosyl unit of the third xylose residue |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. 
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units.

They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.
/
/The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the

/
/In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.
/
/The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.

TYPES - Red-Alage-Galactans
COMMON-NAME - a porphyran
COMMENT - Porphyran is a sulfated carbohydrate extracted from the cell wall of red seaweeds belonging to the genus |FRAME: TAX-2784| |CITS: [Anderson65]|. Unlike |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| and |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenan|, porphyran is not utilized as ingredient for its gelling or texturizing properties. However, it is one of the most consumed algal polysaccharides because it is the main component of edible |FRAME: TAX-2788| and |FRAME: TAX-2785|, both of which are extensively used in the preparation of sushi |CITS: [Correc11]|.
/
/The backbone of porphyran is composed of about 30% of |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| repeating units (1,3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose followed by 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-&alpha;-L-galactopyranose), with the remaining residues being 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate. The 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate residues can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-13430| by the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.5-RXN "galactose-6-sulfurylase, EC 2.5.1.5"|.
/
/In addition, the galactan backboned is decorated by methyl-ether groups at the C6 position of the 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose residues.
/
/As other sulfated galactans, porphyran may have some potential pharmacological applications |CITS: [18796647]|, based on, for example, its hypolipidemic |CITS: [19202270]| and anti-allergic properties |CITS: [16244430]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Agarans Agarans| and |FRAME: Agaroses agaroses| are sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from sea weeds belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-2763| (red algae), mainly from |FRAME: TAX-2769|, and species from the |FRAME: TAX-31444| and |FRAME: TAX-33664| genera.
/
/The basic units of |FRAME: Agarans agarans| are repeats of &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked L-galactose units, which are substituted by sulfate. Different types of agarans have sulfate groups at different positions |CITS: [1367970]|. 
/
/In |FRAME: Agaroses agaroses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6-anhydro bridge. These bridges are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds, by forming a double helix during the process.

They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.
/
/The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the
/number and the position of sulfated ester |CITS: [1367970]|. 
/
/In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.
/
/The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

COMMON-NAME - Moorella thermoacetica
COMMENT - |FRAME: TAX-1525| is a strictly anaerobic Gram-positive acetogenic bacterium. It uses electrons from different substrates to reduce |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| to |FRAME: ACET| by the |FRAME: CODH-PWY Wood-Ljungdahl| pathway. Since acetate is the only product of the pathway, the organism is considered a homoacetogen.
/
/However, |FRAME: TAX-1525| can use electron acceptors other than |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|, such as |FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|, |FRAME: S2O3|, and |FRAME: DMSO|. Under most conditions, nitrate reduction occurs preferentially to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| reduction.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans Glucuronoxylans| are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|. They are linear polymers of &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl units linked by (1&rarr;4) glycosidic bonds, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2, 3 or 2,3-linked glucuronate residue, which are often methylated at position 4.
/Most of the glucuronoxylans have single 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-d-glucopyranosyl uronate residues (MeGlcA) attached at position 2. This structural type is usually named as 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-D-glucurono-D-xylan (MGX).
/
/An unusual heteroxylan in which some of the glucurunosyl residues are further substituted at position O-2 by |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| has been reported from the wood of |FRAME: TAX-34317| |CITS: [10515063]|.

COMMENT - Leptothrix discophora is a sheath-forming bacterial species which is characterized by the precipitation of iron and
/manganese oxides on its sheaths. Strain SS-1 was first described by Adams and Ghiorse. Upon subcultivation
/in the laboratory, it lost its ability to form a structured sheath. It retained its manganese-oxidizing ability, and during growth, a manganese-oxidizing factor is excreted into the medium |CITS: [16346750][3818545]|.
